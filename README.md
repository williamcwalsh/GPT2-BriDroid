# GPT2-BriDroid
A fine-tuned GPT-2 model trained on ≈50,000 texts my friend Brio sent to our groupchat. It mimics his texting style — i.e., tone, slang, and humor– and generates responses based off input prompts. Built with HuggingFace Transformers library. Runs locally with no API keys needed, just for fun.
